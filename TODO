Poor man's issue tracker (roughly sorted by priority):

* Shortcut to repeat last tag entered.

* Interface to define new views (edit in/out filters).

* Cycle through multiple files of a picture.
  * Option to set selected one? As a tag?

* When importing, load files first, to check for duplicates
  (ex: in case of a renamed directory).

* Image rotation.

* Text line editing (to enter new tags).

* Asynchronous file loading.

* Mouse support (IMGUI).

* Faster startup time (avoid `find $basedir`).
  * Asynchronous directory loading;
  or
  * Save collection data to a database (how to sync?).

* Display image histogram.

* OSD transparency.

* PicasaWeb upload.
