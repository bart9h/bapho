Poor man's issue tracker
------------------------

Bugs:

* First/last picture not being filtered.

* PictureItr points to .tags file + .tags is deleted = die when seek.


Missing features:

* Interface to define new views (edit in/out filters).

* Cycle through multiple files of a picture.
  * Option to set selected one.

* Zoom in (up to 1/1 pixels).
  * Pan.

* Image rotation.

* Text line editing (to enter new tags, renaming files/dirs).

* CPANize code.

* Missing documentation (README).
  * Usage, keyboard commands.
  * Feature list.


Enhancements:

* Slideshow.

* Mouse support (GUI).

* Display image histogram.

* Upload to photo-hosting web services (PicasaWeb, Flickr, Imgur, etc).

* Folder handling
  * iterator (and better pagination)
  * tagging
  * display (collage)

* Tag cloud.

* Screensaver.

* Set a picture as wallpaper.

* OSD transparency.

* Option to import then run the gui showing only the just-imported pics.

* [!!!] How to handle the lack of timestamp metadata when importing?
	* one possibility: ask user, providing a guess based on other files on the same import batch.

* When importing, load files first, to check for duplicates
  (ex: in case of a renamed directory).


Optimizations:

* Asynchronous image loading.

* Faster image loading.
  * Save jpegs with fullscreen size, and maybe thumbnails too.
  * Implement loading directly from EXIF.

* Read-ahead image loading.
